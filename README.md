## Mchezo-Engine
=============

C++ Game Engine based on SDL

#Note:
The project is still in early development, and a hobby project not to be taken seriously.

The project in actual sense is not a true a game engine but rather a personal framework for use in developing 2d games,
simulations and exploring the mechanics used in developing classical games.

#Dependencies for building the project:
The project in itself compiles but is not executable as it only provides a basic 
framework for the development of games.
